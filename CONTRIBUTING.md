## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use ES6+ features and modules
- Follow existing code formatting (use Prettier)
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Use Playwright for E2E testing
- Mock external services in tests

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm test
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   ```
   
   Use conventional commits:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `test:` for tests
   - `refactor:` for refactoring
   - `chore:` for maintenance

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```
   
   Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

### Integration Development

When adding new integrations:

1. Create a new file in `src/integrations/`
2. Implement the integration interface:
   ```javascript
   export class YourIntegration {
     constructor(config) { /* ... */ }
     async initialize() { /* ... */ }
     async cleanup() { /* ... */ }
     // Integration-specific methods
   }
   ```
3. Add configuration options to `.env.example`
4. Update the main orchestration engine
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Update documentation

### API Development

- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error handling
